# SuperbCrashSiblings

Superb Crash Siblings in a 2D platform fighter that I made for my CS104 class with character designs made by my partner Aidan Mathieu. This was the first big project in the class and we were given 3 weeks to complete it.

The project is completely made in processing and all parts of the game engine were built from scratch. This included basic physics and collisions of rectangles and circles, as well as creating a camera system from scale and tranform functions.
